# Day 15 – Voice-Controlled Task Manager 🗣️✅

This project is part of my [30 Days of React Relearning Journey](https://github.com/Qasim-Rokeeb/) and introduces a simple but powerful voice-enabled task management tool. It allows users to add tasks using voice commands with the SpeechRecognition API, while managing their to-do list interactively.

The Voice-Controlled Task Manager lets users:

- Add tasks by voice using your microphone
- Manage and delete tasks interactively
- Get real-time visual feedback when the voice system is listening
- Switch between light and dark modes
- Enjoy smooth animations via Framer Motion
